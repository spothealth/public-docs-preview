## In-house phone and SMS support
We act as an extension of your team and handle all patient concerns and questions in-house. No low-quality
outsourced support agents.

## A developer-first API experience
Moving fast is important. We've built an API your developers will love to work with and make speed of integration a
priority.

## Automatic problem resolution at no charge
We know here to help. We take care of reshipping kits that are lost in the mail, issuing new kits to patients who had
difficulty collecting their sample, and live phone support to talk them through the recollection. If anything happens
that would harm the patient experience, we'll move heaven and earth to make it right.
