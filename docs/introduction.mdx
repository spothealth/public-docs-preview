# What we offer

A fully branded, end-to-end solution for home testing built from the ground up with patient experience in mind. In
practice, that translates to...

## White-labeled kits and custom packaging projects
Your customers are our customers. We'll work with you to build a clean packaging experience that matches your brand.
We're committed to making every interaction perfect which means we go the extra mile to use high quality packaging
materials that look and feel premium.

branded updates for your customers sent via email and SMS keep them in the loop. Easy tracking updates for your team
via our API.

## Lab integrations with the best in the business
We've built relationships with a network of great labs that help us offer an extensive, and rapidly expanding catalog
of tests. If you want to test it, we'll build it.

## In-house phone and SMS support
We act as an extension of your team and handle all patient concerns and questions in-house. We don't outsource our
support - we're obsessive about patient experience and won't settle for patient touch that doesn't meet our high
standards.

## A developer-first API experience
Moving fast is important. We've built an API your developers will love to work with and make speed of integration a
priority.

## Automatic problem resolution at no charge
We know here to help. We take care of reshipping kits that are lost in the mail, issuing new kits to patients who had
difficulty collecting their sample, and live phone support to talk them through the recollection. If anything happens
that would harm the patient experience, we'll move heaven and earth to make it right.
