## Authentication

You can find your API Token in the “Account Settings” page of the dashboard. The following authentication header
must be present on every request.

```json
{
	"Authorization": "Token <token>"
}
```

## Place an Order

Orders can be created with a single request.

```
POST https://app.spotdx.com/api/v2/orders
```

New orders require a recipient and a list of the type of kits that should be sent. You may optionally include metadata
to be stored with the order as a JSON object.

```json
{
  "kit_types": [
    "health_kit_1"
  ],
  "recipient": {
    "first_name": "Alice",
    "last_name": "Smith",
    "email": "alice123@gmail.com",
    "phone": "1234567890",
    "address": {
      "street1": "123 Main St",
      "street2": "Apt 1",
      "city": "San Francisco",
      "state": "CA",
      "country": "US",
      "zip": "94105"
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "some_key": "some_value"
  }
}
```

We will acknowledge your request by providing the unique ID assigned to your order. You can use this ID to poll for
status updates at any time. This ID will be provided with status updates pushed to the callback URL configured during
onboarding.
