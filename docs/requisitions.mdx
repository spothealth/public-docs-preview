Requisitions let you use Spot's infrastructure to handle logistics, compliance and results for kits built outside of
Spot. Supply us with the sample's barcode, the patient's registration data, and tracking information, and we'll provide
you with tracking updates and results, as well as handling any logistical problems along the way.

We'll send you updates via webhook when a requisition is updated.
