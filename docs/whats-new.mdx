We've rolled out a ton of new features since we launched Spot v1. We're doubling down on our mission to make launching
home testing easier, and the changes we've made in v2 are focused on helping you build more powerful tools.

### An overhaul of our existing endpoints

We've made a lot of small revisions to our existing endpoints to expand the types of queries that can be made. In
particular, we've significantly expanded the amount of data supplied in the list endpoints, and added a large number
of new optional query parameters to filter results further. A new endpoint for retrieving the list of kit types you
can order has also been added.

### Order metadata

A common request has been to be able to track various external pieces of data within Spot. We've added a new `metadata`
field to the order creation endpoint and added a new metadata update endpoint to match.

### Report amendments

We now allow labs to submit amended reports if there are updates during review. These are added to the array of reports
associated with samples with a new `is_amendment` field set to `true`.

### Expanded kit and sample lifecycles

We've revised kit and sample lifecycles to provide more information, and account for more possibilities. In particular,
we've added a new `cancelled` status to kits, samples, and orders, and a new `extra_quality_checks` status to samples
to indicate when we're doing extra validation work behind the scenes that might take a little longer.
